#+TITLE:   An Academic's Opinionated DOOM Emacs Config
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle config.el

* About This Config

This config has evolved over the last few months to reflect my needs as an academic. I initially started with emacs to take notes on papers. I eventually discovered Org-Roam and its supporting packages `org-roam-bibtex` and `org-roam-server`. I hope this config can be useful to other academics who are starting out with DOOM emacs and want to replicate my workflow or are looking to incorporate some of the packages I use into their own configs. The config has since then grown to include `org-super-agenda` and `org-journal` which are two of the packages that I use to keep on track with my commitments and tasks.

** Move to GCC emacs
One of the things that irritated me the most about emacs was how slow it was when the text in one of the files got very long. If a line (paragraphs are considered one line in emacs) gets too long, emacs starts to slow down till you start a new paragraph. As someone who does writing for a living, taking notes, inserting citations, this starts to get very annoying. Upon conversation with the creator of DOOM emacs, I installed GCC emacs. There are a bunch of different ways to do this, but I followed the amazing gist written by [[https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549][mjlbach]]. When I ran into trouble he took time out to help me figure it out. Much thanks to him. As a result, my emacs runs as fast as it ever has.

* What is the workflow:
I have made a couple of posts on reddit about my notetaking. You can find them [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/gfket3/follow_up_from_post_yesterday_academic_writing/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hltl69/org_roam_for_academics_demo/][here]]. This particular [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hltl69/org_roam_for_academics_demo/][post]] has short gifs on my workflow and how everything ties together.


* The Preambles

This section of the config takes care of some of the housekeeping, and default behavior I want in my emacs.Huge thanks to [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#package-loading][Tecosaur]] for allowing me to copy large chunks of his setup.

** Battery Display
I use the same emacs config on my desktop and my laptop. I added a little snippet that shows battery level on my laptop.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(unless (equal "Battery status not available"
               (battery))
  (display-battery-mode 1))                           ; On laptops it's nice to know how much power you have
#+END_SRC


** Full Screen Emacs
I like to emacs to be fullscreen when I open it for the first time.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(if (eq initial-window-system 'x)                 ; if started by emacs command or desktop file
    (toggle-frame-maximized)
  (toggle-frame-fullscreen))
#+END_SRC
** Windows Behavior
The following code allows me to choose which buffer I want to see when I split a window. It first does a split to the right, and then opens Ivy and and shows me a preview.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (+ivy/switch-buffer))
(setq +ivy-buffer-preview t)
#+END_SRC
** Modeline
I expect most of the documents I work on to be UTF - 8, So I don't want to see that taking up space unless the encoding is something different
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (or (eq buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
                          (eq buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)))))
(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+END_SRC
** Windows Layout
I like being able to rotate the windows, and this functionality already exists within DOOM under `SPC w r` and `SPC w R`. Layout rotation is also preferable, so I added this under `SPC w SPC`
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout
      "<left>"     #'evil-window-left
       "<down>"     #'evil-window-down
       "<up>"       #'evil-window-up
       "<right>"    #'evil-window-right
       ;; Swapping windows
       "C-<left>"       #'+evil/window-move-left
       "C-<down>"       #'+evil/window-move-down
       "C-<up>"         #'+evil/window-move-up
       "C-<right>"      #'+evil/window-move-right)
       #+END_SRC
** Windows Title
The following shows just the buffer name and if applicable, the project folder. Moreover, the snippet also gives a visual indication if the file is modifed or not.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq frame-title-format
    '(""
      (:eval
       (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
           (replace-regexp-in-string ".*/[0-9]*-?" "ü¢î " buffer-file-name)
         "%b"))
      (:eval
       (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
         (unless (string= "-" project-name)
           (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ‚óâ %s" " ‚ÄÜ‚óè‚ÄÜ %s") project-name))))))
#+END_SRC

** Fonts
Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here are the three important ones:
 + `doom-font'
 + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
 + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
   presentations or streaming.

 They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd  font string. You generally only need these two:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" :size 18)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" :size 26)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass Nerd Font" :size 18))
#+END_SRC
** Theme
There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the `load-theme' function. I like gruvbox light as it is very easy to read and, to me atleast, looks to be helpful for doing longform writing. I am also partial to zaiste's theme and I toggle between the two.
*** Note: Added doom-flatwhite-theme.elisp
There is a cool new theme that has syntax highlighting, and has a nice light background. The theme file is available in the /theme/ folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;light themes
                                        ;(setq doom-theme 'doom-gruvbox-light)
                                        ;(setq doom-theme 'zaiste)
                                        ;(setq doom-theme 'doom-flatwhite)
;;dark themes
(setq doom-theme 'doom-acario-dark)
#+END_SRC
I also like to see the line numbers. `display-line-numbers-type` controls this functionality. If set to `nil', line numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)
#+END_SRC
** Org Directory and tweaks
If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below, change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads! My org directory lives in dropbox, so that it is accessible from any of my computers. Also helps in backing everything up.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-directory "~/Documents/org/"
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convininet
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
                                        ;org-export-in-background t                  ; run export processes in external emacs process
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart            ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
      org-re-reveal-root "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js")
#+END_SRC

* Packages
 Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:

 - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
 - `use-package' for configuring packages
 - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
 - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to `config.el`. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
   `require' or `use-package'.
 - `map!' for binding new keys

 To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c g k').
 This will open documentation for it, including  demos of how they are used.
 You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c g d') to jump to their definition and see how  they are implemented.
** Org

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org
  :config
  (setq org-babel-default-header-args
        (cons '(:exports . "both")
              (assq-delete-all :exports org-babel-default-header-args))
        org-babel-default-header-args
        (cons '(:results . "output verbatim replace")
              (assq-delete-all :results org-babel-default-header-args))
        )
  )
#+end_src
** Org-Ref
I initially started using this package in order to manage my citations. However, I soon found that this package required a lot of manual work for my liking. I still keep it in my config as it allows me to use citations in org-documents, if I am working on them directly. I can output these org-documents later to pdf or .docx later.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package! org-ref
  :after org
  :init
                                        ; code to run before loading org-ref
  :config
                                        ; code to run after loading org-ref
  )
(setq org-ref-notes-directory "~/Documents/org"
                                        ; org-ref-bibliography-notes "~/Documents/Org/references/articles.org" ;; not needed anymore. Notes now taken in org-roaM
      org-ref-default-bibliography '("~/Documents/masterLib.bib")
      org-ref-pdf-directory "~/Zotero/")

;; (after! org
;;   (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
;;                '(("a"               ; key
;;                   "Article"         ; name
;;                   entry             ; type
;;                   (file+headline "org" "Article")  ; target
;;                   "\* %^{Title} %(org-set-tags)  :article: \n:PROPERTIES:\n:Created: %U\n:Linked: %a\n:END:\n%i\nBrief description:\n%?"  ; template

;;                   :prepend t        ; properties
;;                   :empty-lines 1    ; properties
;;                   :created t        ; properties
;;                   ))) )
#+END_SRC

** Helm-Bibtex
This is the jumping off point in my workflow inside emacs. The config gives the directory of where the PDFs are stored, where I want my notes to be stored, and where the Bibtex file is.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package! helm-bibtex
  :after org
  :init
  ; blah blah
  :config
  ;blah blah
  )

(setq bibtex-format-citation-functions
      '((org-mode . (lambda (x) (insert (concat
                                         "\\cite{"
                                         (mapconcat 'identity x ",")
                                         "}")) ""))))
(setq
      bibtex-completion-pdf-field "file"
      bibtex-completion-bibliography
      '("~/Documents/masterLib.bib")
      bibtex-completion-library-path '("~/Zotero/")
     ; bibtex-completion-notes-path "~/Documents/Org/references/articles.org"  ;; not needed anymore as I take notes in org-roam
      )
#+END_SRC



** Zotxt
Allows for syncing of the notes between zotero and emacs.
*** Note: This package only seems to load initial notes into emacs - Probably not needed anymore.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package! zotxt
  :after org)
;(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "ox-pandoc" starter-kit-dir))
#+END_SRC

** Ox-Pandoc
This is a great package that I use to output org files to different formats.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package! ox-pandoc
  :after org)
;; default options for all output formats
(setq org-pandoc-options '((standalone . _)))
;; cancel above settings only for 'docx' format
(setq org-pandoc-options-for-docx '((standalone . nil)))
;; special settings for beamer-pdf and latex-pdf exporters
(setq org-pandoc-options-for-beamer-pdf '((pdf-engine . "xelatex")))
(setq org-pandoc-options-for-latex-pdf '((pdf-engine . "pdflatex")))
;; special extensions for markdown_github output
(setq org-pandoc-format-extensions '(markdown_github+pipe_tables+raw_html))
#+END_SRC

** ORB : Org-Roam-Bibtex
This fantastic package allows me to use my bibtex file to create and take notes and store them in a zettlekasten.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package! org-roam-bibtex
  :load-path "~/Documents/masterLib.bib" ;Modify with your own path
  :hook (org-roam-mode . org-roam-bibtex-mode)

(setq orb-templates
      '(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) ""
         :file-name "${citekey}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${citekey}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}\n" ; <--
         :unnarrowed t)))
(setq orb-preformat-keywords   '(("citekey" . "=key=") "title" "url" "file" "author-or-editor" "keywords"))

(setq orb-templates
      '(("n" "ref+noter" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)

#+END_SRC


** Org Roam
Fantastic package, the heart of my note taking. This is an implementation of the zettlekasten method inspired by Roam Research. Used in conjunction with `org-roam-bibtex` and `org-roam-server` is central to my workflow.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

#+END_SRC
** Org-Journal
I was tired of using one todo file, and given the temporal nature of tasks, I decided to incorporate org-journal into my workflow. I create a daily note for each day and mark tasks and schedule them as they arise. Moreover, I also keep a running track of all thoughts and notes I might have during a meeting.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

** lsp-ui

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-ui/][lsp-ui]] is a set of UI enhancements built on top of lsp-mode which make Emacs feel even more like an IDE.
Check out the screenshots on the lsp-ui homepage (linked at the beginning of this paragraph) to see examples of what it can do.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-ui
  :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode)

** Company with lsp
[[https://company-mode.github.io/][Company Mode]] provides a nicer in-buffer completion interface than completion-at-point which is more reminiscent of what you would expect from an IDE.
We add a simple configuration to make the keybindings a little more useful (TAB now completes the selection and initiates completion at the current location if needed).

We also use company-box to further enhance the look of the completions with icons and better overall presentation.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company
  :after lsp-mode
  :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
  :bind (:map company-active-map
         ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
        (:map lsp-mode-map
         ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
  :custom
  (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
  (company-idle-delay 0.0))

(use-package company-box
  :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))

** Commenting

Emacs‚Äô built in commenting functionality comment-dwim (usually bound to M-;) doesn‚Äôt always comment things in the way you might expect so we use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]] to provide a more familiar behavior.
I‚Äôve bound it to M-/ since other editors sometimes use this binding but you could also replace Emacs‚Äô M-; binding with this command.

(use-package evil-nerd-commenter
  :bind ("M-/" . evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines))

Oh, and by the way, if ~company-ispell-dictionary~ is ~nil~, then
~ispell-complete-word-dict~ is used instead, which once again when ~nil~ is
~ispell-alternate-dictionary~, which at the moment maps to a plaintext version of
the above.

It seems reasonable to want to keep an eye on my personal dict, let's have it
nearby (also means that if I change the 'main' dictionary I keep my addition).
